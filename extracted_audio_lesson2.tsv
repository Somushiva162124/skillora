0	4000	Welcome back Aliens. My name is Devan Reddy and in this video we will talk about the Python
4000	8400	installation. The thing is we have talked about the language which is very powerful
8400	12160	but then where you will write your code. Of course we can simply open your
13040	18320	notepad and we can write the code which we want. So example I can simply go back here
18320	22000	and I can say okay what type of code I want to write. So it can be anything. It can be let's say
22000	28880	2 plus 3. Now when you say you want to write a code it can be a calculation, a computation. So
28880	35280	basically a normal calculation like adding two numbers or deciding in which stock to invest
35280	41040	or maybe deciding who should be the next CEO. So basically the idea is if you want to write a code
41040	46080	to design a software which can do some activities we have to write a code but where.
46080	50400	If you write the code in the notepad of course you are not getting the output. Where do you
50400	55520	will get the output for this? This is tricky right and that's why in your machine you need
55520	60320	a python interpreter. So basically we have to install some software and in this machine I
60320	65200	don't have it. How do I verify? It's very simple. You can open your command prompt. So if you're
65200	69920	using Windows you can use command prompt to check it or if you're using Mac or Linux
70640	75840	you can open the terminal. So I'm here on command prompt and here let me see if I have Python.
75840	82240	Now basically the way you can check that is by saying Python version and if you get this type
82240	87680	of error which says Python was not found that means in this machine I don't have Python. Okay
87680	94160	with Python 3 you might also check if you do you have Python 3 installed and you can see
94160	98240	nothing is there. So even if you have Python installed sometime it will not work with the
98240	103200	Python command it might work for the Python 3 command. So do check both the versions and in
103200	108240	this machine I don't have any. So how do you get it? So the first thing we need is Python interpreter
108240	113680	and okay let's say we got python interpreter and then you can write a code there. The thing is
113680	119920	in the interpreter it provides you an option of writing a code one line at a time. So of course
119920	126960	you can add two numbers but what if you want to build a big project. Now it can be a scientific
126960	132640	project or a AI project. Now that's what is booming nowadays. So if you want to build an AI project
132640	138480	or a web application or a desktop application where you will do it for that you need a software
138480	144960	where you can write the code test your code run your code debug your code and also deploy your
144960	150080	code to the cloud where you will do it. Now that's why we have to use something called an IDE which
150080	155680	stands for integrated development environment. Now for Python we have a lot of options. Now one
155680	160640	is very famous which is your pie charm. Now this is from JetBrains again in this video I will show
160640	167280	you how to install Python interpreter and the pie charm. So let's start with the interpreter.
167280	172800	So what you will do is in fact in the updated version of Windows when you say Python enter
172800	178000	it will open the Microsoft store but let's say if you don't have this configured that's fine.
178720	183680	What you can do is you can just go to Google and search for Python download. So you can say this
183680	188480	is the option you will get. So of course the first website says Python you can download it from here.
188480	192320	Now in the upcoming videos you might see a different version of Python install and that's
192320	196960	completely fine because in the version difference you will not find a lot of changes. So even those
196960	203120	things those code will work here. Okay. So you can go for Python 3.12 which is the latest version I
203120	209200	feel. So if I click on download so you can see we got download Python 3.12 so you can download
209200	216960	this version 13 is into release so don't use starting at this point. We got 12 which is
217680	223840	3.12. So we can click here and say download. Okay. So you can see it is downloading and
223840	229840	downloading complete. I feel yeah that's done. Now depend upon which OS you have Windows Linux
229840	234560	or Mac depend upon that you can choose from here. So you can say we have different options here
235280	240400	and yeah so that's a thing. So let me click on this and install. So basically I don't have this
240400	244880	install so I will just click here and now this will install the software. Okay. So you can see
244880	249520	we have an option here which is install now or customize. I will go for simple installation
249520	255040	but before doing that I also want to say add a python.exe to the path. Basically even if you
255040	260160	have installed maybe whenever you open a different folder python may not be available there. So if you
260160	266400	do this add a python.exe to your path you don't have to manually search for the installation.
266400	272000	So you can click on this install now and it will take some time. Now if you skip that step of
272000	277280	add to the path then you have to manually set the path but anyway when you do the add to path
277280	282160	you don't have to do the next the other steps. So by the time it is getting installed what we can
282160	288640	do is we can also get the pycharm downloads done. So I will search for pycharm now pycharm is from
288640	294000	JetBrains which is a very famous company for the IDs and software tools. So it helps developers.
294000	299680	Now basically we can also use VS code for python. You can also use anaconda or ideally which is the
299760	305520	interpreter and yeah many more. So I will just click on this I will say download pycharm. The
305520	311440	thing is when you download or when you get to the pycharm it's not actually free. Okay now that's
311440	316080	a twist right. So we have two versions there one is a paid version one is a free version so I would
316080	320160	encourage you to go for the free version but yes once you become a professional once you're
320160	325680	working for a company then it makes sense to use the paid version. So this is the website and as
325680	330800	I mentioned this is developed by JetBrains which is the website here it's also the company and we
330800	336000	also have a community version. So if you want the community version you can scroll down and you can
336000	342160	see we have two different versions professional and community. I will click on the community version
342160	347520	if you go for the professional version you will get trial for one month. So you decide if you want
347520	351520	to use it or not but I would encourage you to use the community version. So it's going to be
351520	357360	downloaded let me go back to my python setup and looks like python setup is completed let me click
357360	363280	on close. So setup is complete how do I verify again we have to go to command prompt now one
363280	368720	thing to remember even if you have installed a python and if you directly do this it may not
368720	375520	work so you have to reopen your command prompt. So now if I say cmd and let me try now python
376080	380480	version and you can see we got python installed this time we are getting a version number we're
380480	385360	not getting that error which was getting earlier. So yeah python is installed now how do I test it
385360	390080	it's very simple you simply say python it will open the interpreter now this is where you can
390080	395040	write a code of course doesn't look good right maybe you need a software where you will find in
395040	399840	fact if you have learned some other languages you can write the code you can see the project you can
399840	405920	run the code we'll see that in pycharm but here you can see we got the interpreter and here I can
405920	411280	simply add those two numbers and it is working right so you can yeah you can do calculations
411280	416480	computations whatever you can do in this prompt apart from this if you want to open python you
416480	421200	can also search for python so you can see it will also give you an app so you can also use this one
421200	426480	this is the ideally from python in fact ideally looks like something like this so this is the
426480	432160	python interpreter you can also use ideally yeah I know wide theme a lot of people don't like it
432240	437760	but for youtube videos you know it makes sense to have a light theme it looks good it also encourages
437760	443520	you to learn more but anyway that's your choice if you want to use a white or black or dark especially
443520	448560	for me I prefer to use dark theme when I'm coding and for videos I prefer white themes anyway that's
448560	453120	a different debate so I can just use this I can also say two plus three here I'm not sure if the
453120	459520	font is visible but that's not important if I say two plus three enter okay we got syntax error again
459520	464160	I will say 2.3 I think I've entered something weird okay so you can see we got five there so yeah
464160	469040	you can do this here you can do that here or in the command prompt which we have opened earlier
469040	474400	but what about the pycharm so we got the pycharm installation done so you can see we got pycharm
474400	479280	download complete I will click on that taking some time and if you can see yes okay now setup
479280	484880	is very simple here you just have to say next next it will detect the python as well the setup
484880	491120	I'll click on next install again we'll take some time okay looks like a bulky software
491120	495520	they're doing a lot of extraction but that's a that's a thing with IDs you know they are bulky
495520	499200	otherwise you can also use VS code if you want that's your personal choice everything which we
499200	506000	are doing in pycharm or on the ideally it will also work on VS code okay setup complete and I can
506000	513520	also say run here from here or I can simply click on finish let me open pycharm taking some time again
513680	519840	okay I don't want to import these settings any import click on okay so basically I'm using pycharm
519840	524720	on this machine for the first time so you will get some extra prompts okay so what you can do here
524720	529520	is you can create a project you can name any project you can name anything you want I can click
529520	537200	on create and voila you got your project here so this is how the pycharm looks like and that's
537200	542160	your python code again don't get confused with the code here we'll understand this one step by step
542160	547040	but this is yeah this is your python code here you can even run this if you want but it will take
547040	551600	some time anyway we are going to see the pycharm how to use it later in the course so yeah that's
551600	556560	it from this video where we have to set up for the python interpreter and pycharm so if you and if
556560	560320	you are enjoying this series make sure that you hit that subscribe button and also hit the bell
560320	572160	icon because that's how you will know when I upload the other videos on the platform
