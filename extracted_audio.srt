00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back, aliens. My name is Nevin Reddy and finally, we are starting with a series on Python or Python.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It doesn't matter how you pronounce it. What matters is it is one of the fastest growing language in what terms in terms of number of developers

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
who are using it, in terms of the number of libraries we have, in terms of number of companies who are using it and in terms of the areas you can implement it.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You talk about machine learning, you talk about GUI, software development, web development, you can use it everywhere.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And that's why it is also called as a general purpose language.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So in this video, we are going to talk about what is Python and why it is so useful and why you should learn it.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what is Python? As I mentioned, Python is a programming language, of course, but it is also an interpreted object-oriented and high-level language.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, does it mean you cannot do procedures here? You can. It also supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It depends upon your purpose, right? You can use it the way you want.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But why Python is so famous? We have C, C++, Java, JavaScript and still Python is famous?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, some people say that Python is a new language and not exactly.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Java came into picture in 1995 and Python came in 1989. So it's way before Java, right?

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now, so when Java came into picture, the enterprise market, you know, everyone started using Java, but then Python was there.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know, it was there for other people to use example.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's say if you want to learn a language for the first time, Python was there.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But now, since the advancement of machine learning AI, this is a field where we have research scientists.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They don't want to spend much time on learning programming language.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what they do, they went for the easiest language available and the easiest language available in the market is Python.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And yes, Python is damn easy. It is much simpler than C, C++ and Java.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's why most of the colleges and schools, they are teaching Python.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You might be thinking, which company uses Python?

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, let's just list those small, small companies who uses Python.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We have Google, we have YouTube, we have Dropbox.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So we can see we have all these companies who are using Python as a main language or as a support language.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For example, let's say Google has so many features.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Some of those features is code in Python.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now, in the same way, we have this one of the big website called Reddit.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Reddit is today written in Python.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now, let's focus on this name Python.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In fact, when you talk about C, C++, Java, these names, they have some story, right?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What about Python?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's just because this language looks like a snake.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Not exactly.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The author of Python, he's a big fan of a British comedy movie called as Monty Python's Flying Circus.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And that's why he went with the name called as Python initially.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then when everyone liked it, he went for the same name.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now, can they learn Python?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And the answer is yes.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It is one of the easiest languages to learn.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And even if you are from a non-technical background, you have not written any code, you can start with Python.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What if I say Python came into picture just to help those people who don't know how to write a code?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In fact, children can learn Python.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's that easy.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, Python has multiple versions.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We have 1.x, we have 2.x, and we have 3.x.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And of course, we should be learning 3.x, right?

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That means 2.x is not in the market.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And the answer is no.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The 2.x is still in the market.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because when 3.x came into picture, it was very different from 2.x.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Normally what happens in programming language, you know, when Java 8 came into picture,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
so it was backward compatible with Java 1.7.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When Java 1.7 came into picture, it was backward compatible with 1.6.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But that's not the case with Python.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You know, the two different versions has two different way of working.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And that's why we have 2.x still running in the market.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And it does have a support till 2020.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So which one you should learn?

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Of course, 3.x, right?

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because it is new and there will be a lot of features which you can work on.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So that's the introduction from this video.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
In the next video, we'll talk about how to install Python, how to work with different stuff.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then the entire series, we will enjoy this language.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So I hope you will be watching this series.
