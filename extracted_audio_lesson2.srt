00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back Aliens. My name is Devan Reddy and in this video we will talk about the Python

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,400
installation. The thing is we have talked about the language which is very powerful

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,160
but then where you will write your code. Of course we can simply open your

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,320
notepad and we can write the code which we want. So example I can simply go back here

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
and I can say okay what type of code I want to write. So it can be anything. It can be let's say

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,880
2 plus 3. Now when you say you want to write a code it can be a calculation, a computation. So

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,280
basically a normal calculation like adding two numbers or deciding in which stock to invest

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,040
or maybe deciding who should be the next CEO. So basically the idea is if you want to write a code

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,080
to design a software which can do some activities we have to write a code but where.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,400
If you write the code in the notepad of course you are not getting the output. Where do you

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,520
will get the output for this? This is tricky right and that's why in your machine you need

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,320
a python interpreter. So basically we have to install some software and in this machine I

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,200
don't have it. How do I verify? It's very simple. You can open your command prompt. So if you're

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,920
using Windows you can use command prompt to check it or if you're using Mac or Linux

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,840
you can open the terminal. So I'm here on command prompt and here let me see if I have Python.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,240
Now basically the way you can check that is by saying Python version and if you get this type

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,680
of error which says Python was not found that means in this machine I don't have Python. Okay

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,160
with Python 3 you might also check if you do you have Python 3 installed and you can see

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,240
nothing is there. So even if you have Python installed sometime it will not work with the

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
Python command it might work for the Python 3 command. So do check both the versions and in

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
this machine I don't have any. So how do you get it? So the first thing we need is Python interpreter

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,680
and okay let's say we got python interpreter and then you can write a code there. The thing is

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,920
in the interpreter it provides you an option of writing a code one line at a time. So of course

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,960
you can add two numbers but what if you want to build a big project. Now it can be a scientific

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,640
project or a AI project. Now that's what is booming nowadays. So if you want to build an AI project

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,480
or a web application or a desktop application where you will do it for that you need a software

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,960
where you can write the code test your code run your code debug your code and also deploy your

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,080
code to the cloud where you will do it. Now that's why we have to use something called an IDE which

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,680
stands for integrated development environment. Now for Python we have a lot of options. Now one

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,640
is very famous which is your pie charm. Now this is from JetBrains again in this video I will show

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,280
you how to install Python interpreter and the pie charm. So let's start with the interpreter.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,800
So what you will do is in fact in the updated version of Windows when you say Python enter

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
it will open the Microsoft store but let's say if you don't have this configured that's fine.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,680
What you can do is you can just go to Google and search for Python download. So you can say this

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,480
is the option you will get. So of course the first website says Python you can download it from here.

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,320
Now in the upcoming videos you might see a different version of Python install and that's

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,960
completely fine because in the version difference you will not find a lot of changes. So even those

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,120
things those code will work here. Okay. So you can go for Python 3.12 which is the latest version I

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,200
feel. So if I click on download so you can see we got download Python 3.12 so you can download

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,960
this version 13 is into release so don't use starting at this point. We got 12 which is

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,840
3.12. So we can click here and say download. Okay. So you can see it is downloading and

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
downloading complete. I feel yeah that's done. Now depend upon which OS you have Windows Linux

43
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
or Mac depend upon that you can choose from here. So you can say we have different options here

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
and yeah so that's a thing. So let me click on this and install. So basically I don't have this

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,880
install so I will just click here and now this will install the software. Okay. So you can see

46
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,520
we have an option here which is install now or customize. I will go for simple installation

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,040
but before doing that I also want to say add a python.exe to the path. Basically even if you

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,160
have installed maybe whenever you open a different folder python may not be available there. So if you

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,400
do this add a python.exe to your path you don't have to manually search for the installation.

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,000
So you can click on this install now and it will take some time. Now if you skip that step of

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,280
add to the path then you have to manually set the path but anyway when you do the add to path

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,160
you don't have to do the next the other steps. So by the time it is getting installed what we can

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,640
do is we can also get the pycharm downloads done. So I will search for pycharm now pycharm is from

54
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,000
JetBrains which is a very famous company for the IDs and software tools. So it helps developers.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,680
Now basically we can also use VS code for python. You can also use anaconda or ideally which is the

56
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,520
interpreter and yeah many more. So I will just click on this I will say download pycharm. The

57
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,440
thing is when you download or when you get to the pycharm it's not actually free. Okay now that's

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,080
a twist right. So we have two versions there one is a paid version one is a free version so I would

59
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,160
encourage you to go for the free version but yes once you become a professional once you're

60
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,680
working for a company then it makes sense to use the paid version. So this is the website and as

61
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
I mentioned this is developed by JetBrains which is the website here it's also the company and we

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,000
also have a community version. So if you want the community version you can scroll down and you can

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,160
see we have two different versions professional and community. I will click on the community version

64
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,520
if you go for the professional version you will get trial for one month. So you decide if you want

65
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
to use it or not but I would encourage you to use the community version. So it's going to be

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,360
downloaded let me go back to my python setup and looks like python setup is completed let me click

67
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,280
on close. So setup is complete how do I verify again we have to go to command prompt now one

68
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,720
thing to remember even if you have installed a python and if you directly do this it may not

69
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,520
work so you have to reopen your command prompt. So now if I say cmd and let me try now python

70
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,480
version and you can see we got python installed this time we are getting a version number we're

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,360
not getting that error which was getting earlier. So yeah python is installed now how do I test it

72
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,080
it's very simple you simply say python it will open the interpreter now this is where you can

73
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,040
write a code of course doesn't look good right maybe you need a software where you will find in

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,840
fact if you have learned some other languages you can write the code you can see the project you can

75
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,920
run the code we'll see that in pycharm but here you can see we got the interpreter and here I can

76
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,280
simply add those two numbers and it is working right so you can yeah you can do calculations

77
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,480
computations whatever you can do in this prompt apart from this if you want to open python you

78
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,200
can also search for python so you can see it will also give you an app so you can also use this one

79
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,480
this is the ideally from python in fact ideally looks like something like this so this is the

80
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,160
python interpreter you can also use ideally yeah I know wide theme a lot of people don't like it

81
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,760
but for youtube videos you know it makes sense to have a light theme it looks good it also encourages

82
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,520
you to learn more but anyway that's your choice if you want to use a white or black or dark especially

83
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,560
for me I prefer to use dark theme when I'm coding and for videos I prefer white themes anyway that's

84
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,120
a different debate so I can just use this I can also say two plus three here I'm not sure if the

85
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,520
font is visible but that's not important if I say two plus three enter okay we got syntax error again

86
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,160
I will say 2.3 I think I've entered something weird okay so you can see we got five there so yeah

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,040
you can do this here you can do that here or in the command prompt which we have opened earlier

88
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,400
but what about the pycharm so we got the pycharm installation done so you can see we got pycharm

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
download complete I will click on that taking some time and if you can see yes okay now setup

90
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,880
is very simple here you just have to say next next it will detect the python as well the setup

91
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,120
I'll click on next install again we'll take some time okay looks like a bulky software

92
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,520
they're doing a lot of extraction but that's a that's a thing with IDs you know they are bulky

93
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,200
otherwise you can also use VS code if you want that's your personal choice everything which we

94
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,000
are doing in pycharm or on the ideally it will also work on VS code okay setup complete and I can

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,520
also say run here from here or I can simply click on finish let me open pycharm taking some time again

96
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,840
okay I don't want to import these settings any import click on okay so basically I'm using pycharm

97
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,720
on this machine for the first time so you will get some extra prompts okay so what you can do here

98
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,520
is you can create a project you can name any project you can name anything you want I can click

99
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,200
on create and voila you got your project here so this is how the pycharm looks like and that's

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,160
your python code again don't get confused with the code here we'll understand this one step by step

101
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
but this is yeah this is your python code here you can even run this if you want but it will take

102
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
some time anyway we are going to see the pycharm how to use it later in the course so yeah that's

103
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,560
it from this video where we have to set up for the python interpreter and pycharm so if you and if

104
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,320
you are enjoying this series make sure that you hit that subscribe button and also hit the bell

105
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:32,160
icon because that's how you will know when I upload the other videos on the platform
